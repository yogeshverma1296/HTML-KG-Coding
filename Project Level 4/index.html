            Glory to the Shri Krishna sankirtana (congregational chanting of the
            Lord's holy names), which cleanses the heart of all the dust
            accumulated for years and extinguishes the fire of conditional life,
            of repeated birth and death. That sankirtana movement is the prime
            benediction for humanity at large because it spreads the rays of the
            benediction moon. It is the life of all transcendental knowledge. It
            increases the ocean of transcendental bliss, and it enables us to
            fully taste the nectar for which we are always anxious.

            O my Lord, Your holy name alone can render all benediction to living
            beings, and thus You have hundreds and millions of names, like
            Krishna and Govinda. In these transcendental names, you have
            invested all Your transcendental energies. There are not even hard
            and fast rules for chanting these names. O my Lord, out of kindness
            You enable us to easily approach you by Your holy names, but I am so
            unfortunate that I have no attraction for them.
